# Python Engineering Workspace

This repository contains my Python practice and mini-projects focused on
engineering and technical computing applications.

The objective of this repository is to build strong fundamentals in:
- Python programming
- Numerical computing using NumPy
- Data visualization using Matplotlib
- Applying Python to mechanical / automotive engineering problems
